# Fraud Detection System for E-Commerce and Banking

This project focuses on developing a robust fraud detection system for e-commerce transactions and bank credit transactions. The system aims to tackle the unique challenges of both transaction types by employing advanced machine learning techniques, geolocation analysis, and transaction pattern recognition to improve detection accuracy.

Accurate fraud detection enhances transaction security, reduces financial losses, and builds trust with both customers and financial institutions. By leveraging detailed data analysis and modern machine learning models, this project aims to spot fraudulent activities in real-time and enable efficient monitoring and reporting for rapid response.

### Project Features:
- **Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare transaction data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop features that reveal patterns indicative of fraud.
- **Model Development**: Train machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measure and enhance model accuracy, focusing on minimizing false positives.
- **Real-Time Deployment**: Deploy models for live fraud detection and set up continuous monitoring and reporting.
